# VR-Reaction-Simulation
This was my final project for **[CPS 643 - Virtual Reality at Ryerson University](http://www.scs.ryerson.ca/tmcinern/Courses/cps643.html)**. 

To run the game:
1. Laucnh Unity **Version 2017.0.3f or newer**
2. File -> Open -> Final Project 
3. In Unity, open the "scenes" folder and run any of the scenes.
4. Make sure you have a VR controller setup with valid roomspace (you require lots of movement).
5. Hit play.
